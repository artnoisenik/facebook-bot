# facebook-bot

###Summary

This bot will connect to your Wit-AI account and allow you to reference the stories you create in that account. It also has a place holder to put a weather API (or other) if you wish. You can find the stories under my wit username: artnoisenik and the project name: FlixFriend. I will be updating and changing stories when I have the time.
